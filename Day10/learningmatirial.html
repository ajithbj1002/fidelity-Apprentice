    <h1>What is Java?</h1>
    <p title="Sample Title">Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation</p>
    <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Platform Independent:</dt>
        <dd>Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java a platform-independent language</dd>
        <dt>Object-Oriented Programming:</dt>
        <dd>Java promotes the use of objects and classes, making it easier to organize and reuse code. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="reasons">Java continues to be a cornerstone of modern software development, widely used across industries and platforms.</p>
